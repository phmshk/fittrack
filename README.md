# FitTrack: A Modern Nutrition & Calorie Tracker

FitTrack is a web application designed to help users track their daily food intake, monitor calories and macronutrients, and achieve their fitness goals. This project is inspired by popular apps like Lifesum and MyFitnessPal and is built as a portfolio piece to showcase modern frontend development practices.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The codebase is organized following the **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)** methodology. This architectural pattern helps in maintaining a clean, scalable, and well-structured application by dividing the code into layers and slices.

- **`app`**: Global configurations, styles, and providers (e.g., router setup).
- **`pages`**: The entry points for specific routes, composed of features and widgets.
- **`features`**: Chunks of business logic that provide value to the user (e.g., `add-food-to-diary`).
- **`entities`**: Business-critical entities (e.g., `user`, `food-item`).
- **`shared`**: Reusable, framework-agnostic code used across the application (e.g., UI components, API clients, utility functions).

This structure makes the project easy to navigate, maintain, and scale.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash

    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses `npm` as the package manager.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    This will start the Vite development server, typically on `http://localhost:5173`.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application should now be running in your browser!
